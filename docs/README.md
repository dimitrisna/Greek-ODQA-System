# Greek Open-Domain Question Answering System System

In the current project, an attempt has been made to design and develop a Greek Open-Domain Question Answering System. The scripts and the files of this project can be used to develop similar projects in other languages. To use this project clone it.
```
git clone https://github.com/dimitrisna/Greek-ODQA-System.git
cd Greek-ODQA-System
```

## Translating datasets

Use the scripts of the folder QA_dataset_translation to translate SQuAD-like QA datasets and convert them in HuggingFace compatible format. Before executing the scripts install the deep_translator package
```
pip install deep_translator
```

## Training of Reader and DPR retriever

Use the Notebooks of the folder Reader_DPR_training to train your own Reader and Retriever Models

## Downloading Wikipedia Files

To download the necessary Wikipedia data for the system, use the notebook Wikipedia_data_download.ipynb

## Installation of the Open-Domain Question Answering System

Before the installation, in the file  rest_api/pipeline/pipelines.haystack-pipeline.yml you can make the choise of the prefered retriever type.
To import the Wikipedia data in the project run the following commands
```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
```
Based on the type of retriever you prefer, execute the script write_docs_bm25.py or write_docs_dpr.py to import the Wikipedia data to the DocumentStore.

To install the ODQA System, run the following commands
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

The application UI can be found by navigating to http://localhost:8501
